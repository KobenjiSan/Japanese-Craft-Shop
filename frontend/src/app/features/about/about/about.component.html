                木漏れ日 (Komorebi) Japanese Craft Shop is a demo e-commerce 
                catalog built to showcase full-stack development skills while 
                simulating the experience of browsing and collecting authentic 
                Japanese crafts. Designed for craft enthusiasts and design-minded 
                users, it demonstrates an end-to-end system including authentication, 
                product CRUD, admin dashboard, file uploads, and dynamic 
                filtering/sorting. The project was built entirely from scratch, 
                combining Angular 20 + Tailwind CSS on the frontend with an ASP.NET 
                Core Web API backend following CQRS + MediatR + DTOs, secured with JWT, 
                and powered by MongoDB. While fictional, the app weaves in the aesthetic 
                of komorebi (sunlight filtering through leaves) blending cultural 
                inspiration with technical execution.

            <p class="text-justify">
                The name 木漏れ日 (Komorebi) comes from Wim Wenders' film Perfect Days, 
                a movie I first watched before my study abroad in Japan and then carried 
                with me during that time. Its quiet focus on light through trees, daily 
                rituals, and contentment in ordinary life mirrored what I experienced in 
                Japan: the mindfulness and joy found in small moments. That sense of 
                stillness and presence inspired the way I shaped this project as not just 
                an app, but as a digital space meant to feel intentional and unhurried.
